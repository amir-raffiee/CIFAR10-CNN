# CIFAR10-CNN
In this project a convolution neural network model has been developed using tensorflow. All You need to do to run the code is to read CIFAR10 data set (I already inculded the code for this purpose in data_utils.py). You can simply change the architecture of the network by changing the model function in model.py. Feel free to change the hyperparameters to see their effects on the model performance. 
Have fun
